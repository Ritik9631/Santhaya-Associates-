# MEMORY.md — Project continuity log
Updated: 2026-10-26 | Phase: 2 Planning | Implementation status: Phase 1 Completed & Approved; Phase 2 Planning

## Confirmed decisions
- Project: Santhaya Associates corporate website plus staff-only quotation and GST billing system.
- Public quotation requests require no client login; staff manage quotations.
- Business areas: government/private construction tenders, construction machinery supply, manufacturing machinery supply.
- Stack: Next.js App Router + strict TypeScript + Tailwind + Lucide + Zod; Supabase PostgreSQL/Auth/RLS planned; Vercel hosting; GitHub; server-generated PDFs and transactional email later.
- Brand palette: navy #10243B, gold #F4B323, white #FFFFFF; use actual company logo when supplied.
- Indian GST invoicing planned; place-of-supply, tax classifications and invoice obligations require accountant validation.
- Work in sequential phases with explicit human approval before proceeding.

## Implemented features
- Phase 1 Complete (Approved 2026-10-26):
  - Next.js 14 App Router scaffold with strict TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
  - Responsive header incorporating authentic `santhaya-logo-header.png` (84.125px × 64px, 1.314:1 aspect ratio, 0.00% distortion) and mobile menu drawer with `santhaya-symbol.png`.
  - Scope-locked service pages for 3 core pillars: Government & Private Construction Tenders, Construction Machinery Supply, Manufacturing Machinery Supply.
  - About Us, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service pages.
  - Client-side validated quotation request form with Zod schema and prominent non-operational preview warning.
  - Verified with 0 lint errors, 0 typecheck errors, successful static build (9/9 routes), and headless Chrome automated QA across mobile (375px), tablet (768px), laptop (1366px), and desktop (1920px).

## Completed tasks
- 2026-10-26: Prepared Santhaya-only starter documentation and preserved the technical executive summary as reference.
- 2026-10-26: Initialized local Git repository and created initial commit for asset and history traceability.
- 2026-10-26: Verified genuine brand assets in `public/`:
  - `santhaya-logo-header.png` (1045x795, 1.314 aspect ratio, RGB): Used for website header with strict aspect ratio preservation.
  - `santhaya-symbol.png` (480x550, 0.873 aspect ratio, RGB): Used as compact brand icon in mobile menu, footer, and browser icons.
  - `full-brand-reference.png` (1254x1254, 1.000 aspect ratio, RGB): Featured on homepage showcase as official visual reference.
- 2026-10-26: Verified runtime environment: Node v24.18.1, npm 11.16.0 (via `npm.cmd` on Windows).
- 2026-10-26: Phase 1 Final QA executed via headless Chrome automation suite (`scripts/run-qa.mjs`):
  - Tested 6 routes (`/`, `/services`, `/about`, `/request-quotation`, `/privacy`, `/terms`) across 4 viewports (375px, 768px, 1366px, 1920px). Zero horizontal overflow.
  - Verified Header logo aspect ratio: rendered at 84.125 × 64px (`aspect-[1045/795]`, 1.314:1, 0.00% distortion).
  - Verified mobile drawer menu with compact symbol `santhaya-symbol.png` and full navigation links.
  - Verified demo quotation form: prominent amber non-operational warning banner, client-side validation errors, and simulation success card with no false backend claims.
  - Identified & fixed Phase 1 QA defects:
    1. Added `src/app/request-quotation/layout.tsx` to provide unique page `<title>` and metadata for `/request-quotation`.
    2. Enhanced Zod schema error messages with `required_error` and `.trim()` across all form fields (e.g. "Business or organization name is required" instead of generic "Required").
    3. Added `loading="eager"` to `Footer.tsx` symbol image to prevent lazy-load lag during automated audits.
    4. Installed `sharp` for high-performance Next.js production image optimization.
  - Re-ran verification gates:
    - `npm run typecheck`: Passed (0 errors)
    - `npm run lint`: Passed (0 errors)
    - `npm run build`: Passed (9/9 routes prerendered, 0 warnings)
    - Automated QA script: 0 broken images, 0 console errors, 0 overflow issues across all viewports.
  - Captured full visual QA screenshots saved in artifact directory.
- 2026-10-26: User formally approved Phase 1. Completed Phase 1 milestone.

## Current phase and pending tasks
- [x] Phase 1 completed, QA reviewed, and formally approved by user (2026-10-26).
- [ ] User review and approval of Phase 2 detailed architecture plan.
- [ ] Phase 2 Supabase schema migration and RLS policies.
- [ ] Phase 2 public form server-side persistence, anti-spam, and rate limiting.
- [ ] Phase 2 notification and end-to-end integration tests.
- [ ] Phase 3 staff auth/roles/dashboard.
- [ ] Phase 4 quotation PDFs and lifecycle.
- [ ] Phase 5 GST invoices, orders and payment tracking after professional review.
- [ ] Phase 6 security, accessibility, backup, compliance and deployment checks.

## Design decisions
- Brand palette: Deep Navy `#10243B`, Industrial Gold `#F4B323`, Clean White `#FFFFFF`.
- Typography: Inter font configured via Next.js Google font variable `--font-inter`.
- Logo assets: Never use AI-generated artwork for logos. Use authentic PNGs directly from `/public` with `object-contain` and explicit aspect-ratio constraints (`aspect-[1045/795]` and `aspect-[480/550]`).
- Header responsive sizing:
  - Desktop: `santhaya-logo-header.png` at height 56px–64px (`h-14 md:h-16`, aspect 1045/795) on white header bar.
  - Mobile: `santhaya-symbol.png` (compact mark, height 40px) inside drawer and quick "Get Quote" bar.
  - Official Visual Reference: `full-brand-reference.png` showcased on homepage with 1:1 aspect ratio.

## API and database decisions
Supabase planned; no tables, migrations, endpoints or policies implemented. Phase 1 operates strictly client-side for demonstration. No customer data stored.

## Reusable components
- `Header`: Responsive brand header with desktop nav, mobile drawer, and CTA.
- `Footer`: Comprehensive corporate footer with scope lock, unverified disclaimer, and compliance links.

## Assumptions / awaiting confirmation
Exact legal name confirmed as "Santhaya Associates Pvt. Ltd." via official logo asset. Official registered office address, phone, email, GSTIN, domain, and staff roles remain configurable placeholders.

## Session log
- 2026-10-26: Confirmed construction tenders and machinery supply as exclusive business scope.
- 2026-10-26: Inspected authentic brand assets in `public/`.
- 2026-10-26: Received user approval for Phase 1 scaffolding. Implemented responsive header, homepage, 3 service pillars, about page, legal placeholders, and demo quotation form. Completed typecheck, lint, build, and HTTP verification. All checks passed.
- 2026-10-26: Conducted Phase 1 comprehensive QA. Resolved missing quotation metadata, generic validation messages, and footer image loading. Re-verified lint, typecheck, build, and responsive screenshots across 4 screen sizes. Zero defects remaining. Awaiting user approval to proceed to Phase 2.

## Agent update discipline
Record actual code changes and tests promptly. Never change 'not started' to 'completed' until verified. Mark reversed decisions superseded with date; do not erase history.
